# How it works
This works by...
1. compiling the Crystal code into a static library (.lib)
2. wrapping the static library in a DLL from C

See build.bat for details.

# Building
- Make sure Crystal on WSL is installed
- Open a VS developer command prompt and cd into this repo
- Run build.bat from the developer command prompt
